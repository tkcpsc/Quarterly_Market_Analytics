# Possible Models:
### Regression:
    - Linear Regression
    - Log - Linear Regression
    - Linear - Log Regression
    - Log - Log Regression
    - L1 Lasso Regression
      - A type of linear regression that introduces a penalty on the **absolute values** of coefficients in the model. Penalty leads to some coefficients becoming exactly zero, effectively selecting a simpler model.
    - L2 Ridge Regression
      - A type of linear regression that introduces a penalty on the magnitude of coefficients in the linear model. Penalty helps control the complexity of the model
    - ElasticNet Regression
      - A regularization technique that combines both Ridge and Lasso penalties
    - Decision Trees
    - Neural Networks


### Classification:
    - Logistic Regression
    - Confusion Matrix
        - ROC (Reciever Operator Curve)
    - Decision Trees
    - Regression Trees
    - CART Trees
    - Ensemble Models
    - Random Forest
    - Neural Networks
